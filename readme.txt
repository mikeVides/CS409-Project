# README.txt
## Introduction - Small project worked on by 2 students to test algorithms.


## Instructions for Running the Code

1. **Dataset Location:**
   - The dataset "Global Electricity Stats.csv" is located at the following path:
     ```
     C:\Users\Dell\Documents\Masinya Moses\Random Forest/Global Electricity Stats.csv
     ```

     Please ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access this file. If the file is moved or the path is modified, update the file path accordingly in the code.

   - If you don't have pandas installed, install it using:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas
     ```

   - Load the dataset in your Python code using the following snippet:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd

     # Replace 'your_file_path' with the actual path to the dataset
     file_path = r'C:\Users\Dell\Documents\Masinya Moses\Random Forest/Global Electricity Stats.csv'
     df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

     # Now 'df' contains your dataset, and you can proceed with your analysis.
     ```

2. **Software Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have the required software packages installed, such as Python and the necessary libraries (e.g., scikit-learn).

3. **Running the Code:**
   - Execute the main script or notebook to run the Random Forest algorithm on the provided dataset.
   - Modify any file paths or configurations as needed.
    - Read file:
import pandas as pd

# Local file path to the dataset
file_path = r'C:\Users\Dell\Documents\Masinya Moses\Random Forest\Global Electricity Stats.csv'

# Load the dataset into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
df.head()


     -Learning Curves for Regression

import pandas as pd

# Local file path to the dataset
file_path = r'C:\Users\Dell\Documents\Masinya Moses\Random Forest\Global Electricity Stats.csv'

# Load the dataset into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
df.head()


4. **Additional Files:**
   Jupyter Notebook File (e.g., analysis.ipynb):
   Python File (e.g, ds_deliverable_three.py):

This file contains your code, explanations, and visualizations. It should be a self-contained document that someone else can run to reproduce your analysis.
Dataset File (e.g., Global_Electricity_Stats.csv):

Include the dataset file you are working with. This is the CSV file containing your data.
README.txt File:

This file contains instructions for running your code and any additional information someone might need. It should include details on how to set up the environment, install dependencies, and execute the code.
Requirements.txt File:

If your Jupyter Notebook depends on specific Python packages, list them in a requirements.txt file. You can generate this file using the command pip freeze > requirements.txt.
Scripts or Additional Modules (if any):

If you have separate scripts or Python modules that are necessary for the code execution, include them in the project directory.
